As the leader-litmus at the Entrepreneurship Development Cell and previously a Social Media Head at SFSG -AITR, and active member of EDC and IIC, I welcome opportunities to foster innovation, collaborate with like-minded individuals. My past involvement in the promotion team of E-Summit at Acropolis adds to my entrepreneurial spirit.
